# OpenStreetMap Case Study

## Introduction
<p>My task is to investigate a data set from a location of my choosing from openstreetmap. I need identify problems, clean it and store the data in SQL. Then, I am to explore the data programmatically and propose ideas on how to improve the data set. This investigation is a practice project needed to complete the Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity.
